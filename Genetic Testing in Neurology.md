Genetic Testing in Neurology 

Foreword
Genetic testing has become a cornerstone of modern neurology, offering clinicians powerful tools to unravel the molecular basis of neurological disorders. These methodologies vary in scope, resolution, and application, each tailored to address specific diagnostic challenges. Below is a detailed exploration of the key genetic testing modalities used in clinical practice, their strengths, limitations, and relevance to neurological disease.

Karyotyping
Karyotyping is one of the oldest and most foundational genetic tests. It involves staining and visualizing an individual’s chromosomes under a microscope to detect large-scale structural abnormalities, such as missing or duplicated chromosomes (e.g., trisomy 21 in Down syndrome), translocations, or major deletions. While karyotyping is cost-effective and invaluable for diagnosing conditions caused by gross chromosomal changes, its resolution is limited. It cannot detect small mutations, such as single nucleotide changes or microdeletions, which are often responsible for neurological disorders. Despite its limitations, karyotyping remains useful for diagnosing syndromes like Prader-Willi or Angelman, where larger chromosomal rearrangements on chromosome 15 are implicated.

Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH)
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) builds on karyotyping by adding precision. This technique uses fluorescent DNA probes that bind to specific chromosomal regions, allowing clinicians to identify microdeletions or duplications that are invisible under a standard microscope. For example, FISH is routinely used to diagnose velocardiofacial syndrome, caused by a small deletion in chromosome 22 (22q11.2). While FISH is faster and more targeted than karyotyping, it is limited to testing predefined regions of interest. If a clinician does not know which chromosomal region to probe, FISH becomes impractical, making it a supplementary rather than first-line test in many cases.

Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA)
Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA) represents a significant leap forward in detecting copy-number variants (CNVs)—submicroscopic deletions or duplications across the genome. By scanning the entire genome at high resolution, CMA can identify imbalances as small as 50-100 kilobases. This makes it a first-line test for neurodevelopmental disorders like autism spectrum disorder or unexplained intellectual disability, where CNVs are common. However, CMA cannot detect balanced chromosomal rearrangements (e.g., inversions or translocations) or single-gene mutations, necessitating additional testing for a comprehensive diagnosis.

Targeted Gene Panels
Targeted gene panels focus on sequencing a curated set of genes known to be associated with a specific clinical phenotype. For instance, an epilepsy panel might include genes like SCN1A (linked to Dravet syndrome) or KCNQ2 (associated with neonatal seizures). These panels are cost-effective and efficient, as they avoid the "noise" of irrelevant genomic regions. However, their utility depends on the clinician’s ability to narrow down the suspected diagnosis. If the genetic cause lies outside the panel’s scope—or if the disorder is genetically heterogeneous—targeted panels may miss the culprit variant.

Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (WES/WGS)
Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) represent the most comprehensive approaches. WES analyzes all protein-coding regions of the genome (~2% of the total DNA), while WGS examines the entire genome, including non-coding regions. These methods are particularly valuable for diagnosing rare, undifferentiated neurological disorders with complex or unknown genetic causes, such as atypical leukodystrophies or early-onset neurodegenerative diseases. WES/WGS can uncover novel mutations and solve diagnostic odysseys, but they come with challenges. The sheer volume of data requires sophisticated bioinformatics tools, and distinguishing pathogenic variants from benign ones—especially variants of uncertain significance (VUS)—remains a major hurdle. Cost and accessibility also limit their widespread use, though prices continue to decline.

Repeat Expansion Analysis
Many neurological disorders, such as Huntington disease and fragile X syndrome, are caused by abnormal expansions of short DNA repeats. Repeat expansion analysis uses specialized techniques like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or Southern blotting to measure the length of these repetitive sequences. For example, Huntington disease is diagnosed by detecting CAG repeats in the HTT gene: more than 40 repeats confirm the disease. While this method is definitive for known repeat disorders, it is limited to testing predefined loci and cannot identify other types of mutations.

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) Analysis
Mitochondrial disorders, which affect energy production in cells, often arise from mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Techniques like mtDNA sequencing or deletion analysis are critical for diagnosing conditions such as mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) or Leigh syndrome. Because mitochondria have their own DNA and are present in hundreds to thousands of copies per cell, testing requires specialized methods to detect heteroplasmy—a mixture of mutated and normal mtDNA within a single patient. This complexity makes mtDNA analysis both technically challenging and essential for certain diagnoses.



Future Directions
Emerging technologies, such as long-read sequencing and CRISPR-based diagnostics, promise to overcome current limitations. Long-read sequencing, for example, can resolve complex repeat expansions and structural variants that short-read methods miss. Meanwhile, advances in artificial intelligence are improving variant interpretation, reducing the burden of VUS. As these tools mature, they will further integrate genetic testing into routine neurological care, paving the way for earlier diagnoses and personalized therapies.

Choosing the Right Test: A Clinical Perspective
The choice of genetic test depends on the clinical context. For a child with global developmental delay and dysmorphic features, CMA or karyotyping might be the first step. In contrast, a patient with a family history of adult-onset ataxia would benefit from targeted testing for spinocerebellar ataxia genes or repeat expansion analysis. Whole exome sequencing often serves as a "last resort" for enigmatic cases, though its role is expanding as costs decrease and interpretation improves.

Importantly, no single test is universally superior. Each modality complements the others, and a tiered approach—starting with targeted tests and escalating to broader analyses—is often the most pragmatic strategy. Genetic counseling is critical throughout this process to manage patient expectations, interpret results, and address ethical concerns, such as incidental findings or implications for family members.

In summary, genetic testing modalities in neurology form a diagnostic toolkit that balances breadth, depth, and practicality. By understanding the strengths and limitations of each method, clinicians can navigate the genetic landscape of neurological disorders with precision, ultimately improving patient outcomes through targeted interventions and informed family planning.
